In order to complete this task one of the most important elements was working with an SSH key. I had not done that before, but now used an SSH-key to connect to both the digital ocean server and GitHub. A SSH key is a secure method of authentication.
Also the use of GitHub Actions was new to me it took a while to get a grasp of the yaml syntax. But the use of GitHub actions very useful: it will trigger a set of actions on a certain GitHub event (for example push).
To store all my private information, the SSH keys and the server information for digital ocean, I used GitHub secrets. This is a method to store and encrypt your data, but can access it through variables in GitHub Actions.

A problem I ran into was first to get the pytest working. This was relatively simple to solve as I needed to install pytest. The second problem was the workflow logic: by default several actions run simultaniously, but I wanted to update the files on the server only if the tests passed. so I used 'needs: run-tests' in my deploy action. The problem I struggled with the most was the connection to the digital ocean server. At one point I had it working, but then, I don't really know why, I couldn't connect to it anymore. I tried several things, but ended up starting over with a new droplet and a new SSH-key. It's not an elegant solution, but it worked.
